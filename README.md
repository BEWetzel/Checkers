# Checkers
A TypeScript checkers game I'm developing to run in the Node.js console environment

# Installation
1. Download the repository from github
2. Install Node.js v20.2.0 or higher on you machine. The latest version can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/download. 
3. Now your device should be ready to run the game. 

# Running the game
1. Open Node.js Command Prompt. The window will display the active version og Node.js and the Active Directory.
2. Navigate the active directory to the rownloaded repository's root. If it is in the same drive as the current active directory, then use the command 'cd X:/filePath/OfTheDirectory/RootFolder'
3. Enter the 'node checkers.js' command into the Command Prompt to begin playing.
